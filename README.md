# Deep Learning From Scratch

This repository contains **basic implementations of deep learning algorithms** built from scratch using Python and NumPy.

The goal of this project is to understand the **core mechanics behind deep learning models** without relying on high-level frameworks.

## Implemented Components
- Backpropagation
- Convolution
- Batch Normalization
- Dropout
- Adam optimizer
- Learning rate schedulers

## Purpose
This repository is intended for **educational use**, focusing on clarity and correctness of core algorithms rather than performance or scalability.
